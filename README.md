# Dragable Blocks 

Dragable Blocks is inspired by OneNote's flexible editing interface, allowing users to add and position text blocks anywhere within the window using HTML divs (not canvas). Users can freely move, resize, and customize each block's font size, style, alignment, and font family, enabling a highly interactive and personalized editing experience.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop:** Move blocks freely around the workspace.
- **Resizable Blocks:** Adjust the size of each block to fit your content.
- **Customizable Text:** Change font size, style, alignment, and font family.
- **Flexible Layout:** Position blocks anywhere, similar to OneNote.
- **No Canvas:** Built entirely with React, HTML, and CSS using div elements.
